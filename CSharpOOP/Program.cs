            Add an inaccessible stress level variable, initialized at 0. 
	            -When homework is done, increase stress by 30. 
	            -When sleep is done, decrease stress by 50 (or 5 per hour).
	            -When games are done, decrease stress by 25.
	            -Add a floor to stress level of 0 (similar to ceiling on energy).

            Add a query method for stress level and that will output a string based on its level.

            Throw an exception if stress tries to go over 100.
