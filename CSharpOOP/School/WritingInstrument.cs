            Create a Pencil class that has a similar behaviour to Pen, except uses a GraphiteRemaining property rather than ink level.
                GraphiteRemaining will start at 100%, and decrease by 0.1% per character written.

            Set the WritingInstrument property in Student to be polymorphic.
